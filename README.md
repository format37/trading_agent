# Claude SDK Trading Agent

AI-powered cryptocurrency trading agent built with Claude SDK and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), featuring systematic CSV-based data analysis and conservative risk management for live market trading.

## Architecture

**CSV-First Data Analysis Workflow**

The agent operates on a structured data pipeline that promotes systematic, evidence-based decision-making:

- **Data Collection**: MCP servers (Polygon + Binance) fetch market data, technical indicators, news, and account information
- **CSV Storage**: All tools save results to CSV files in the shared `data/` folder (mounted across MCP servers and agent)
- **Python Analysis**: Agent reads CSV files and executes pandas/numpy code to analyze patterns, calculate metrics, and identify signals
- **Trading Decisions**: Multi-factor analysis across 7+ dimensions (momentum, trend, price position, order book, sentiment, liquidity)
- **Risk Management**: Conservative position sizing, stop-loss automation, and portfolio diversification

**Multi-Phase Trading Process**

Each trading session follows a disciplined 5-phase workflow:

1. **Market Assessment** - Status, news, gainers/losers, account balance
2. **Technical Analysis** - RSI, MACD, EMA, SMA indicators across multiple timeframes
3. **Data Analysis** - Python-based CSV analysis for statistical validation
4. **Trade Execution** - Market/limit/OCO orders with calculated position sizing
5. **Risk Monitoring** - Continuous portfolio review and stop-loss management

## Typical Workflow

```python
# 1. Agent fetches market data from Polygon
polygon_crypto_snapshot_ticker(ticker='X:BTCUSD')
# Returns: "âœ“ Data saved to CSV\nFile: data/mcp-polygon/crypto_snapshot_BTC_a1b2c3.csv"

# 2. Agent reads the CSV file
Read('data/mcp-polygon/crypto_snapshot_BTC_a1b2c3.csv')

# 3. Agent analyzes the data with Python
mcp__ide__executeCode("""
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/mcp-polygon/crypto_snapshot_BTC_a1b2c3.csv')

current_price = df['price'].iloc[0]
volume_24h = df['volume'].iloc[0]
change_24h = df['change_percent'].iloc[0]

print(f"BTC Price: ${current_price:,.2f}")
print(f"24h Change: {change_24h:+.2f}%")
print(f"24h Volume: ${volume_24h:,.0f}")
""")

# 4. Agent fetches technical indicators
polygon_crypto_rsi(ticker='X:BTCUSD', timespan='hour', window=14)
polygon_crypto_macd(ticker='X:BTCUSD', timespan='hour')

# 5. Agent performs multi-factor analysis across all CSVs
# Calculates weighted scores across momentum, trend, sentiment, liquidity

# 6. Agent checks portfolio
binance_get_account()

# 7. Agent executes trades based on data-driven analysis
binance_spot_market_order(symbol='BTCUSDT', side='BUY', quantity=0.001)

# 8. Agent sets protective stop-loss and take-profit
binance_spot_oco_order(
    symbol='BTCUSDT',
    side='SELL',
    quantity=0.001,
    take_profit_price=115000,
    stop_loss_price=110000
)
```

## Trading Strategy

**Conservative Risk Management** (One-Day Horizon)

The agent follows disciplined risk parameters:

- **Capital Preservation First** - Avoid high-risk trades or excessive leverage
- **Position Sizing** - Maximum 5-10% of portfolio per position
- **Stop-Loss Discipline** - Protective stops at 2-3% below entry
- **Risk/Reward Ratio** - Minimum 1:2 reward-to-risk ratio for each trade
- **Diversification** - Maintain exposure across 3-5 uncorrelated assets
- **Leverage Limits** - Minimal leverage (max 2x) only when conditions are highly favorable

**Entry/Exit Rules**

Entry criteria (all must align):
- Multiple technical indicators confirm the same direction
- Risk/reward ratio is favorable (minimum 1:2)
- Market sentiment supports the trade
- Position size fits within risk parameters

Exit triggers:
- Take profit at predetermined targets
- Stop-loss hit (immediate exit)
- Technical setup invalidates (e.g., support breaks)
- End of day if position hasn't moved as expected

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Claude SDK (`claude-agent-sdk`)
- Running MCP servers:
  - Polygon MCP (port 8009)
  - Binance MCP (port 8010)
- Shared data folder with proper permissions

### Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Mount shared data folder
./mount.sh

# Configure environment
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
```

### Environment Configuration

The agent connects to MCP servers configured in `main.py`:

```python
mcp_servers={
    "polygon": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:8009/polygon/"
    },
    "binance": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:8010/binance/"
    }
}
```

Ensure both MCP servers are running and accessible before starting the agent.

### Data Folder Setup

The `data/` folder is mounted via `mount.sh` to enable CSV sharing between MCP servers and the agent:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p ./data
sudo mount --bind /home/alex/projects/data/ ./data
```

This ensures all CSV files saved by MCP tools are immediately accessible to the agent for analysis.

## Usage

### Starting the Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

The agent will:
1. Load the conservative trading system prompt from `trading_prompt.md`
2. Connect to Polygon and Binance MCP servers
3. Execute an initial market assessment for BTC and ETH
4. Enter interactive mode for conversation

### Interactive Mode

Once the agent completes its initial analysis, you can:

```
[Turn 2] You: Please execute the rebalancing strategy you recommended

[Turn 3] You: Show me the P&L for my last 10 trades

[Turn 4] You: Analyze ETH technical indicators and recommend entry points
```

Commands:
- `exit` or `quit` - End the trading session
- `interrupt` - Stop Claude's current task
