# Claude SDK Trading Agent

AI-powered cryptocurrency trading agent built with Claude SDK and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), featuring systematic CSV-based data analysis and conservative risk management for live market trading.

## Architecture

### Subagent-Powered Parallel Analysis

The trading agent leverages **8 specialized subagents** for parallel execution and domain expertise:

**Asset Research Agents** (Run in Parallel):
- **btc-researcher**: Bitcoin-specific analysis (technical, on-chain, institutional flows)
- **eth-researcher**: Ethereum ecosystem analysis (DeFi, Layer 2, network metrics)
- **altcoin-researcher**: Opportunity discovery in mid/small-cap cryptocurrencies

**Specialized Analysis Agents**:
- **market-intelligence**: Web research specialist (Perplexity-powered macro/sentiment analysis)
- **technical-analyst**: Pure chart analysis expert (multi-timeframe, support/resistance)
- **risk-manager**: Portfolio risk assessment and position sizing validator
- **data-analyst**: Python/pandas statistical analysis specialist
- **futures-analyst**: Futures trading specialist (leverage, funding rates, liquidation risk)

**Key Benefits**:
- **2-3x Faster**: Parallel subagent execution vs sequential analysis
- **Deeper Insights**: Each subagent has specialized expertise and separate context
- **Better Decisions**: Main agent synthesizes multiple expert perspectives
- **Risk Control**: Risk manager validates every trade before execution

### CSV-First Data Analysis Workflow

The agent operates on a structured data pipeline that promotes systematic, evidence-based decision-making:

- **Data Collection**: MCP servers (Polygon + Binance) fetch market data, technical indicators, news, and account information
- **CSV Storage**: All tools save results to CSV files in the shared `data/` folder (mounted across MCP servers and agent)
- **Python Analysis**: Agent reads CSV files and executes pandas/numpy code to analyze patterns, calculate metrics, and identify signals
- **Trading Decisions**: Multi-factor analysis across 7+ dimensions (momentum, trend, price position, order book, sentiment, liquidity)
- **Risk Management**: Conservative position sizing, stop-loss automation, and portfolio diversification

**Multi-Phase Trading Process with Subagents**

Each trading session follows a disciplined workflow orchestrated by the main agent with specialized subagents:

1. **Parallel Market Assessment**
   - Main agent launches btc-researcher, eth-researcher, and market-intelligence subagents IN PARALLEL
   - While subagents analyze, main agent checks market status and account balance
   - Collect and synthesize all subagent reports
   - **Speed**: 2-3 minutes vs 5-6 minutes sequential

2. **Technical Validation**
   - Delegate to technical-analyst subagent for objective chart analysis
   - Optional: Use data-analyst for statistical validation
   - Receive precise entry/exit levels and technical score

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - ALWAYS use risk-manager subagent before executing trades
   - Validates position sizing and portfolio risk
   - Provides APPROVED/REDUCE/REJECT verdict

4. **Trade Execution**
   - Execute only when multiple subagents confirm direction
   - Use technical analyst's entry/exit levels
   - Follow risk manager's position sizing

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Risk manager periodically checks portfolio health
   - Adjust positions based on changing conditions

## Typical Workflow

```python
# 1. Agent fetches market data from Polygon
polygon_crypto_snapshot_ticker(ticker='X:BTCUSD')
# Returns: "âœ“ Data saved to CSV\nFile: data/mcp-polygon/crypto_snapshot_BTC_a1b2c3.csv"

# 2. Agent reads the CSV file
Read('data/mcp-polygon/crypto_snapshot_BTC_a1b2c3.csv')

# 3. Agent analyzes the data with Python
mcp__ide__executeCode("""
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/mcp-polygon/crypto_snapshot_BTC_a1b2c3.csv')

current_price = df['price'].iloc[0]
volume_24h = df['volume'].iloc[0]
change_24h = df['change_percent'].iloc[0]

print(f"BTC Price: ${current_price:,.2f}")
print(f"24h Change: {change_24h:+.2f}%")
print(f"24h Volume: ${volume_24h:,.0f}")
""")

# 4. Agent fetches technical indicators
polygon_crypto_rsi(ticker='X:BTCUSD', timespan='hour', window=14)
polygon_crypto_macd(ticker='X:BTCUSD', timespan='hour')

# 5. Agent performs multi-factor analysis across all CSVs
# Calculates weighted scores across momentum, trend, sentiment, liquidity

# 6. Agent checks portfolio
binance_get_account()

# 7. Agent executes trades based on data-driven analysis
binance_spot_market_order(symbol='BTCUSDT', side='BUY', quantity=0.001)

# 8. Agent sets protective stop-loss and take-profit
binance_spot_oco_order(
    symbol='BTCUSDT',
    side='SELL',
    quantity=0.001,
    take_profit_price=115000,
    stop_loss_price=110000
)
```

## Trading Strategy

**Conservative Risk Management** (One-Day Horizon)

The agent follows disciplined risk parameters:

- **Capital Preservation First** - Avoid high-risk trades or excessive leverage
- **Position Sizing** - Maximum 5-10% of portfolio per position
- **Stop-Loss Discipline** - Protective stops at 2-3% below entry
- **Risk/Reward Ratio** - Minimum 1:2 reward-to-risk ratio for each trade
- **Diversification** - Maintain exposure across 3-5 uncorrelated assets
- **Leverage Limits** - Minimal leverage (max 2x) only when conditions are highly favorable

**Entry/Exit Rules**

Entry criteria (all must align):
- Multiple technical indicators confirm the same direction
- Risk/reward ratio is favorable (minimum 1:2)
- Market sentiment supports the trade
- Position size fits within risk parameters

Exit triggers:
- Take profit at predetermined targets
- Stop-loss hit (immediate exit)
- Technical setup invalidates (e.g., support breaks)
- End of day if position hasn't moved as expected

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Claude SDK (`claude-agent-sdk`)
- Running MCP servers:
  - Polygon MCP (port 8009)
  - Binance MCP (port 8010)
- Shared data folder with proper permissions

### MCP Servers

This project utilizes the following Model Context Protocol (MCP) repositories:

- **[mcp-binance](https://github.com/format37/mcp-binance)** - Provides comprehensive Binance exchange integration including spot trading, futures trading, account management, and portfolio analytics
- **[mcp-polygon](https://github.com/format37/mcp-polygon)** - Delivers market data and technical analysis capabilities through Polygon.io APIs including real-time prices, historical data, and technical indicators

### Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Mount shared data folder
./mount.sh

# Configure environment
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
```

### Environment Configuration

The agent connects to MCP servers configured in `main.py`:

```python
mcp_servers={
    "polygon": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:8009/polygon/"
    },
    "binance": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:8010/binance/"
    }
}
```

Ensure both MCP servers are running and accessible before starting the agent.

### Data Folder Setup

The `data/` folder is mounted via `mount.sh` to enable CSV sharing between MCP servers and the agent:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p ./data
sudo mount --bind /home/alex/projects/data/ ./data
```

This ensures all CSV files saved by MCP tools are immediately accessible to the agent for analysis.

## Usage

### Starting the Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

The agent will:
1. Load the conservative trading system prompt from `trading_prompt.md`
2. Connect to Polygon and Binance MCP servers
3. Execute an initial market assessment for BTC and ETH
4. Enter interactive mode for conversation

## Subagent Architecture

### How Subagents Work

Subagents are specialized AIs orchestrated by the main trading agent. Each subagent has:

1. **Specialized System Prompt**: Domain-specific expertise and instructions
2. **Restricted Tools**: Only the tools necessary for their role
3. **Separate Context**: Won't pollute main agent's context with detailed analysis
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple subagents can run simultaneously

### Subagent Prompts

All subagent prompts are stored in `prompts/` directory:

```
prompts/
â”œâ”€â”€ btc_researcher.md       # Bitcoin analysis specialist
â”œâ”€â”€ eth_researcher.md       # Ethereum ecosystem specialist
â”œâ”€â”€ altcoin_researcher.md   # Altcoin opportunity discovery
â”œâ”€â”€ market_intelligence.md  # Web research & macro analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ technical_analyst.md    # Pure chart analysis expert
â”œâ”€â”€ risk_manager.md         # Portfolio risk assessment
â”œâ”€â”€ data_analyst.md         # Statistical analysis specialist
â””â”€â”€ futures_analyst.md      # Futures trading & leverage specialist
```

**Customization**: Edit these prompts to adjust subagent behavior, expertise, and analysis style.

### Parallel Execution Example

When main agent invokes:
```python
# In a single message, launch multiple subagents:
- Use btc-researcher for BTC analysis
- Use eth-researcher for ETH analysis
- Use market-intelligence for macro research
```

**Result**:
- All 3 subagents run simultaneously
- Each maintains separate context (no cross-contamination)
- Main agent receives 3 comprehensive reports
- Total time: ~90 seconds (vs ~270 seconds sequential)

### Tool Restrictions by Role

**Read-Only Subagents** (Cannot execute trades):
- market-intelligence: Only Perplexity tools + polygon_news
- risk-manager: Only account/risk analysis tools
- technical-analyst: Only price data + indicators
- data-analyst: Only Python execution + Read

**Research Subagents** (Can fetch data but not trade):
- btc-researcher: Polygon + Perplexity + Binance market data
- eth-researcher: Polygon + Perplexity + Binance market data
- altcoin-researcher: Polygon + Perplexity + Binance market data

**Trading Specialist** (Can analyze and recommend but main agent executes):
- futures-analyst: Binance futures data + liquidation calculator + leverage tools
  - Analyzes funding rates and basis spreads
  - Calculates safe leverage levels (max 2-5x recommended)
  - Validates liquidation risk before futures positions
  - Can recommend futures positions but main agent executes

**Main Agent** (Full authority):
- All MCP tools including spot and futures trading execution
- Can invoke any subagent
- Makes final trading decisions
- Executes both spot and futures orders

## System Prompt

The agent's behavior is defined in `system_prompt.md`, which includes:

- Subagent orchestration strategy (NEW)
- Parallel execution workflow (NEW)
- Conservative risk management principles
- Multi-phase trading process with subagent delegation
- Entry/exit rules with technical criteria
- Position sizing formulas
- Tool usage guidelines
- Decision-making framework with subagent synthesis
