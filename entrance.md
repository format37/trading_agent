I've implemented some new futures tools:
| Tool                               | Type       | Description                        |
  |------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
  | binance_get_futures_balances       | READ       | Account balance, margin, positions |
  | binance_trade_futures_market       | WRITE      | Execute market orders              |
  | binance_futures_limit_order        | WRITE      | Place limit orders                 |
  | binance_get_futures_open_orders    | READ       | View open orders                   |
  | binance_cancel_futures_order       | WRITE      | Cancel orders                      |
  | binance_get_futures_trade_history  | READ       | View trade history                 |
  | binance_set_futures_leverage       | WRITE      | Set leverage/margin                |
  | binance_manage_futures_positions   | READ/WRITE | View/close positions               |
  | binance_calculate_liquidation_risk | READ       | Risk analysis                      |

  So I would like to make one small futures order for test purposes. Please, choose the best configuration and create. I am expecting to see the new futures order in my binance app. If u would meed any issues with tools, please, note about this, with tech details helping me to fix the issue or tune the tool docstring.

  Yestaerday we decided to not trade due to bearish market:
  ```
  ## üéØ MY RECOMMENDATION

**I recommend OPTION A: Wait 2-4 hours**

**Why:**
1. **Market Structure:** BTC is literally testing critical support RIGHT NOW
2. **Risk/Reward:** Current moment has worst R/R ratio in 24 hours
3. **Tool Testing:** Can test equally well at $109K (confirmed bounce) as at $108K (knife edge)
4. **Philosophy:** Testing tools shouldn't compromise trading principles

**The tools will work just as well when we have:**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed support hold
- ‚úÖ RSI oversold reversal
- ‚úÖ Proper entry setup

**Then we can open a 3x leveraged position with $15 USDT, targeting $113K (+4%), with full conviction and proper risk management.**

---

## ‚ùì YOUR DECISION

I'm happy to execute whichever you prefer:

**A) Wait 2-4 hours for proper setup** (my strong recommendation)
- Test tools with full position when conditions align
- Much higher probability of success
- Demonstrates discipline

**B) Open minimal test position NOW** ($5, 2x leverage)
- Tests tools immediately
- Minimal risk ($0.54 max loss)
- Preserves capital for real opportunity

**C) Proceed with your original vision** ($17, higher leverage)
- I'll execute but must note strong objection
- Violates all analysis conclusions
- High probability of loss given market conditions
  ```

I've decided to wait and now about 10 hours passed.
So let's make futures order with SLTP limits. U can do both long or short and futures configuration that u prefer.
If u decides that now is sirky moment for futures, then please, make futures order for a small amount. We need to test the futures tools.

Recently we had issues with permissions. I've resoved all access issues. Let's try again. Use tool notes if u met any issues.
